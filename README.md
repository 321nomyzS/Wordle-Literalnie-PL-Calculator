# Wordle/Literalnie PL Calculator

## Project Overview üåü

This project serves as a sophisticated tool for calculating the best possible word guess in the Wordle or Literalnie game specifically tailored for the Polish language. It is an assistant that evaluates the information provided about the current state of the word and suggests the most strategic choice for the next move. Words are ranked based on the frequency of letters they contain in the Polish language and whether they are in the nominative case, which is a requirement for words to be valid solutions in Wordle/Literalnie.

A significant feature of this project is the implementation of Morfeusz2, a comprehensive tool for the morphological analysis of Polish language, which allows for the identification of word formations including grammatical cases. This feature is crucial for the app's functionality as it ensures the accuracy of the word analysis.
